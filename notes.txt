Packet Crafting

Scapy Challenge Ideas:
- ip spoofing
  - "I only accept packets from this specific ip address."
    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41166420/sending-a-packet-over-physical-loopback-in-scapy
    - https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#i-can-t-ping-127-0-0-1-or-1-scapy-does-not-work-with-127-0-0-1-or-1-on-the-loopback-interface
    - ^^^ I Hate this
    - We have to do `conf.L3socket = L3RawSocket` for this to work.
    - LOWERCASE L3socket!!!!!!!
  - "I only accept ipv5."
  - "I am an evil program, I only accept EVIL packets https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_bit"
  - Can do like 3 of these
  - "Admin connects from this ip address"
    - Submit hash of password field
  - Hardcoded length at buffer[20] or whatever, but ip headers can be longer
- Buffer overflow w/ naive length parsing at layer 4
  - Reader.c
  - Simple variable overflow
  - Shellcode
- Packet replay: Sending an exact sequence of bytes, but with custom tcp
  - "We can't get into this binary! All we have is this pcap."
  - "Here's the protocol: This field is a timestamp, and we verify it."
    - Slight modification to packet relay

  - https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-38063
  - Real packet crafting vulnerability found this summer
  - Leads to RCE on MS Windows by sending malformed packets
  - Integer underflow
  - 9.8 CVE
- BRUTE FORCE WARNING
  - We are going to be mentioning, not really covering, a few (not many) brute
    force techniques. DO NOT attack the RPI network, the network admins mean
    business and WILL send you an email. You are being tracked at the wifi
    level and packet forgery WILL NOT protect you.
- Sniffing
  - We will not be sniffing today, as we are mostly not doing network analysis,
    though it is a legitimate network recon technique and available in scapy.
- Packet Parsing
  - For gigabit wireless speeds, lower layer parsing is sometimes done in hardware
  - For embedded stuff, (mostly our targets), parsing is often just done in software
- Scapy
  - Wireshark is better for packet analysis, and it is easy to collect pcaps with it
  - Scapy is a tool that can do pcaps, but is more suited for sending packets
  - Scapy is a generic tool. Meant to be hacky, but not specifically for offensive security.
  - Higher level: nc, pwntools
- IP Spoofing
- Buffer Overflow
- Packet replay


- Physical Router Challenges
  - nmap? (DISCLAIMER DO __NOT__ RUN THIS ON RPI WIFI)
  - aircrackng(? Irrelevant tbh)

- Minecraft challenge (raise your hand when you get to the crypto part)
  - Not relevant anymore

- Connection hijacking

Useful commands:
- help(IP) (man page)
- ls(IP) (list fields)

man socket
man packet

Replay?
- Example Scenario https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication#Simple_example_mutual_authentication_sequence
- Client: login: alice
- Server: Welcome, alice! Challenge: (randomly generated from a pool of like 5)
- Client: Challenge response: (the response)
- Server: Authenticated! My next message will contain the flag.
- Server: flag{12345} (Cut out of pcap)

Replay 2:
- Same as replay 1 but you need current timestamps, modify those on the fly

Obviously you can get around replays by just sending the straight bytes any other way, its the concept that matters.
Maybe combine with ip spoofing?


Docker solve for 1
echo -en "\x00\x10Hello!" | nc -u localhost 54321

Physical Ideas:
ARP Spoofing (Router is sending to a specific IP addr, become that)
Port scanning (One port is giving flag away for free, find that)
MITM1 (Just listen)
- Can also be solved with promiscuous mode sniffing
MITM2 (Modify bytes)
- There is a checksum, but the salt never changes, so you can do it manually
MITM3 (Modify bytes)
- There is a checksum, but the salt keeps changing, so you have to intercept or script it
MITM4 (Modify bytes)
- You have to take over the key exchange
